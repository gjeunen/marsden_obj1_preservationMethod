## 1. Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive guide and supplementary information for the bioinformatic and statistical analysis of the manuscript entitled "Unlocking Antarctic molecular time-capsules - recovering historical environmental DNA from museum-preserved sponges" by Jeunen *et al*., 2024. This work is associated with the Marsden Fast-Start fund (MFP-UOO002116).

## 2. Environment set up

### 2.1 Starting files

The bioinformatic and statistical analysis requires access to several files, including the sequencing data and metadata files.

The two raw g-zipped sequencing files can be downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) project number PRJNA1019816 and submission number SUB13856226. The files names are: "**8373-P1-00-01_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz**" and "**8373-P2-00-01_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz**". Download both sequencing data files and place them in the starting folder.

Besides the sequencing data, two metadatafiles are necessary to conduct the bioinformatic and statistical analysis, both of which can be downloaded from this GitHub repository in the folder "**metadata_files**". The first metadata file named "**barcodeMetadata8373.fasta**" will be used for demultiplexing, while the second metadata file named "**sampleMetadata8373.csv**" will be used for the statistical analysis. Place both metadata files into the starting folder.

In the Terminal, move to the starting folder. When listing the files, all starting files should be listed in the Terminal window.

```{code-block} bash
cd move/to/starting/folder
ls -ltr
```

## 3. Bioinformatic analysis

### 3.1 Initial data check

Before starting the bioinformatic pipeline, check the structure and quality of the raw sequencing files using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). First, unzip the raw sequencing data files using `gunzip`.

```{code-block} bash
gunzip *.gz
```

Next, analyse the quality and structure of raw sequencing data files using `fastqc`. Both libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq using the sequencing kit V2 1x300 bp.

```{code-block} bash
mkdir fastqc_raw
fastqc *.fastq -t 8 -o fastqc_raw/
```

Samples were sequenced across two sequencing runs. To simplify the code, combine both files using the `cat` command.

```{code-block} bash
cat *.fastq > 8373Combined.fastq
```

### 3.2 Demultiplexing

#### 3.2.1 Adapter removal

Prior to demultiplexing, remove the Illumina sequencing adapter on the 3' end of the reads using [cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Removing these adapters enables the anchoring of the barcodes and primers for demultiplexing due to the library build specifications, i.e., reads will start and end with the barcode and primer sequences. Roughly 82% of reads should pass this filtering step.

```{code-block} bash
cutadapt 8373Combined.fastq -a ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG -o 8373Combinedp7removed.fastq --discard-untrimmed --no-indels --cores=0
```

#### 3.2.2 Assigning reads

Once Illumina adapters are removed, demultiplex data the data using [cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Note that in the metadata file, information starts with `^` and ends with `$`, indicating the anchoring of barcode sequences. Additionally, since primer regions need to be removed as well, the metadata file specifies the barcode + primer region as the adapter to be removed. Since multiple files will be generated during demultiplexing, one per sample, place newly generated files in a new folder using the code below.

```{code-block} bash
mkdir demux
cutadapt 8373Combinedp7removed.fastq -g file:'barcodeMetadata8373.fasta' -o demux/{name}.fastq --discard-untrimmed --no-indels -e 2 --cores=0
```
